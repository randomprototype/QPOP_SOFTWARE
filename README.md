# QPOP_SOFTWARE

Welcome to the official repository of the **QPOP (Quasi-periodic opportunistic policy)** , a web application for planning the maintenance of critical systems when resources are limited. This application has been developed by [Augusto J. S. Rodrigues](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7042-9270), [Yan R. Melo](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6487-8742) and [Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1466-656X).

This tool was designed for broad accessibility in the industry, eliminating the need for extensive knowledge of mathematical modeling or programming languages.

## On the maintenance policy model

The basis of this software is the model described in the paper **"Planning maintenance when resources are limited: a study of periodic opportunistic replacement"**, by Cristiano Cavalcante, Phil Scarf, Yan Ribeiro, Augusto Rodrigues & Naif Alotaibi. (https://doi.org/10.1093/imaman/dpae015)

## Collaborations

We welcome contributions, feedback, and discussions regarding the software and the policy model it implements. Whether you're a researcher, industry professional, or enthusiast in the field of maintenance planning and protection systems, your insights are invaluable to us.
